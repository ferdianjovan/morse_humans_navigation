morse_humans_navigation
=======================

multiple robots/humans navigation using waypoints

Run:
  roslaunch morse_humans_navigation humans_navigation.launch
  
You need to run morse environment first with each a robot named "human<number>" possessing pose information named "pose<number>" in your simulator. It currently works perfectly with https://github.com/ferdianjovan/strands_morse

waypoint_generator.py in scripts folder does not work at the moment.
